# APISwitch Release Notes

## APISwitch v0.3.2 Release Notes

### [Key Feature · Gemini 4 (Argon) Independent Quota & Limit Monitoring]
• Account cards overhauled with a Triple-Column Quota Panel (Gemini models, **Gemini 4 Argon**, and Claude & GPT models).
• Direct integration with Google Cloud Code quota endpoint (`retrieveUserQuotaSummary`) to extract and monitor the `argon` quota bucket:
  - **Gemini 4 Dedicated 5-Hour Dynamic Limit (5H)**: Displays remaining quota percentage, high-precision progress bar, and reset countdown.
  - **Gemini 4 Dedicated Weekly Base Quota**: Real-time weekly pool status, consumption progress, and reset cycle.
• **Subscription Tier & Quota Entitlement Awareness**:
  - Distinguishes official Paid Subscriptions ("PRO") from Promotional / Trial Quotas ("EXP").
  - Paid subscription accounts unlock the full, dedicated Gemini 4 Argon quota pool;
  - Promotional and trial accounts display "Shared with Gemini" or "No separate quota" with comprehensive hover tooltips explaining entitlements.
• **Historical Quota Snapshot Tracking**: Quota snapshot service records historical `gemini-argon-5h` and `gemini-argon-weekly` fluctuations over time.

### [New · Expanded Client Usage Monitoring (Gemini CLI / StepCode / zcode / dsh)]
• Added Gemini CLI local session scanning and ingestion (automatically parses `%TEMP%\gemini_chat_*.json` with high-performance transactional bulk insertion for millions of tokens).
• Added StepCode local session scanning, correcting token measurement criteria to precisely reflect true input/output token consumption.
• Added zcode and dsh agent usage monitoring; resolved dsh timestamp millisecond alignment and chronological order issues.
• Extended session scanning and SQLite retention window from 90 days to 400 days (over 1 year of full historical coverage).

### [New · Long-Range Quick Ranges & GitHub / Claude-Style Heatmap Grid]
• Added "6 Months" (180 days) and "1 Year" (365 days) quick range selection buttons.
• Introduced GitHub / Claude-style Contribution Heatmap Grid:
  - 7 rows (Monday to Sunday) across weeks, adapting dynamically to window resizing.
  - Aligned month labels along the top and "Mon / Wed / Fri" weekday indicators on the left.
  - Logarithmic 5-tier indigo intensity coloring to prevent single high-volume spikes from washing out regular daily activity.
  - Hover tooltip displaying date, weekday, total tokens, and input/output breakdown.
  - Interactive drill-down: click any cell to filter the entire window (summary cards, providers, clients, models, and recent calls) to that day; click again to deselect.
• Adaptive chart mode: automatically defaults to Bar Chart for short ranges ($\le 31$ days) and Heatmap Grid for long ranges ($> 31$ days), with manual toggle buttons in the top-right header and dynamic legends.

### [New · In-App Multilingual Update Dialog & Language Switching]
• Update dialog (`UpdateDialog`) automatically matches and renders release notes in the user's active application language (`zh-CN` / `en-US`).
• Added interactive `[中文]` / `[English]` language switch pills in the Changelog header for instant cross-language inspection.
• Offline bilingual fallback to local release notes when remote notes are omitted.

### [Architecture & Engineering]
• Modularized usage scanning: introduced the `IUsageSource` interface and `UsageSourceRegistry` for clean multi-client expansion.
• Standardized Release outputs and removed unnecessary Debug caches.

## APISwitch v0.3.1 Release Notes

### [New · Usage Performance Metrics]
Added three key performance metrics to the Usage Monitor:
• Cache Hit Rate: Summary card displays hit proportion over the selected range (`hits / (fresh input + hits + writes)`), with hit and write token totals in the sub-label.
• Output Speed: Output tokens / duration (tokens/s).
• Time to First Token (TTFT): Elapsed time from request dispatch to first generated content chunk.
• Metrics visible across 4 areas: summary cards, each call row in Recent Calls, and per-model / per-provider drill-down rows with color coding (Purple for cache, Red for speed, Amber for TTFT).
• Recent Calls table expanded from 7 to 10 columns (Time, Client, Provider, Model, In, Out, Total, Cache, Speed, TTFT).
• Selecting a day drills down performance metrics together with token totals.

### [New · Historical Data Backfill]
• Resolves zero-value metrics for existing users upgrading to newer versions.
• Added "Backfill history" button in the bottom-right of the Usage Monitor (and `--backfill-usage` CLI flag).
• Workflow: Auto-backup `usage.db` (timestamped) → clear events table → invalidate scan offsets → full rescan of all local session logs.
• Reports written records, records with cache data, and records with timing data upon completion.

### [New · Codex Model Auto-Fetch]
• Optionally queries the provider for available models (`GET /models`) upon saving and registers them into Codex's model catalog.
• Provider models immediately become selectable in Codex's `/model` picker.
• Graceful error handling with actionable tips for Base URL and API Key checks.

### [New · Cancelable Batch Quota Activation]
• Added a "Cancel Batch" button during batch Antigravity account quota activation.
• Existing successful activations are preserved upon cancellation.

### [New · Safe Client Restart]
• Solved issues where Electron / MSIX-packaged clients (Codex, Claude) failed to restart cleanly.
• Graceful window closure → verify exit → process tree termination if lingering → verified detection of new instance startup before reporting success.

### [Optimizations & Fixes]
• Router gateway metrics: local proxy now captures first-token latency, duration stopwatch, and both OpenAI/Anthropic prompt cache formats.
• Standardized window minimization: clicking "-" or taskbar button minimizes to taskbar; tray minimization is reserved for the close button.
• Fixed CLI window popping up during background `agy.exe` activation via hidden window flags and stdin redirection.
• Fixed quota countdown timer to reference live quota status instead of stale reset times.
• Fixed Claude CLI duration bleed across session files by resetting stopwatch timestamps per file.
• Prevented unbounded memory growth in Codex turn dictionaries with a 2-hour threshold and 5000-entry limit.
• Thread-safe locking in `UsageScanner.ScanAll()` across multiple UI triggers.

## APISwitch v0.3.0 Release Notes

### [Major New Feature · Usage Monitor]
• Summary cards: Total / Input / Output tokens and request counts over any selected range.
• Daily trend chart: Stacked bar chart with empty-bar placeholders for inactive days.
• Click-to-drilldown: Selecting a bar highlights the column and switches all window tables and cards to that day.
• Provider drill-down: Expand providers to inspect per-model consumption.
• Client breakdown: Statistics across Codex, Claude CLI, Claude Desktop, OpenCode, and Pi.
• Virtualized list for Recent Calls: Smooth scrolling over hundreds of records.
• Cross-provider model aggregation: Merges identical models across different providers with casing/suffix normalization.
• Persistent SQLite storage surviving application restarts.

### [New · Local Session Scanning]
• Scans offline activity from Codex (`~/.codex/sessions`), Claude Code (`~/.claude/projects`), Pi (`~/.pi/agent/sessions`), and OpenCode (`opencode.db`).
• Incremental byte-offset tracking avoids duplicate counts.

### [New · Dial-Style Date/Time Picker]
• Custom calendar panel with Monday start and month pagination.
• Dual-ring 24-hour clock dial and 60-minute selection dial with drag-and-click support.
